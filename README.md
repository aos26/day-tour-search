# Branching model for Git
The plan is to use GitFlow as a branching model for git. 
See here: https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html
As well as using this model we use: 
* git revert instead of git reset. 
* git merge instead of git rebase.

These concepts and more useful git commands are covered in a fun game on git branching
(which could also be used for illustrative purposes):

We use Slack to communicate:
